Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm a maintainer of several internal and public projects at (Sogeti)[https://github.com/sogeti].
The most recent project is the (DevSecOps Reference Architecture)[], a visual of DevOps practices and my last article on LinkedIn is on Enterprise DevOps â€“ how to avoid the chaos. DevOps and cloud are close to my heart.
